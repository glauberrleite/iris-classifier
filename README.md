# iris-classifier
An iris plant classification software based on Marchine Learning.It reads a Iris
plant database and classificates entries based on some training in that database.
My goal is that someone who is studying supervised learning could read or run
this project and clarify the concepts as they are used in pratice. Not only
developers, but Data Scientists too, could use it to see how choices in algorithms
and even simple parameters changes the classification performance seen in the [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) at the end of the runtime.

The algorithms implemented are, currently:

* K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) - Almost finished
